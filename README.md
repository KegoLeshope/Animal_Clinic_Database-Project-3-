Project Plan:
==============================
As a team, we have identified that it would be beneficial for the organization to have an database managment system that will allow staff memebers to book in appointments for the animals, generating a suitable date for the appointment. This will help to avoid long queues where some people may end up not getting assisted due to the high volume of people present, and that the clinic only operates according to certain hours a day. This will will also help the staff members to be productive and to avoid unnecessary physical folders and files. 

Tasks:
==============================
GUIS/Databases:
Login/Database = Kegomoditswe Leshope/Marvin Hope
Regitser/Database = Siyabonga Masango/Jayden Johnson
Booking/Database = Tiffany Kiwiets/Raeesah Williams

Protection of Personal Information (POPI) Act:
==============================
What is POPIA?
The Protection of Personal Informal Act is the new data privacy law that came into effect for businesses on July 1st 2021. 
The goal of the POPI Act is to protect data subjects from security breaches, theft, and discrimination. 
The act gives the public right to data privacy, it defines and regulates the processing of personal information. 

What does this mean for us?
We will facilitate all data access and deletion requests. 
Only admin at the animal clinic will have the access to do this. 
Data subjects information will be kept private. 
Information exchanged between the staff and customers should only be actioned once a security check has been done. 

Ethical Policy:
==============================
Our company's Code of Ethics encapsulates the values, concepts, and business practices that influence our operations. Employees are expected to promote a work environment that encourages justice, respect, and integrity. The Code establishes fundamental concepts to aid workers in meeting the minimal criteria required of them.

1. Integrity: Provide professional services with integrity 
Employees' integrity must not be compromised for selfish gain. Integrity cannot coexist with dishonesty or the subordination of one's values.

2.Â Objectivity: Provide professional services objectively
Intellectual honesty and impartiality are required for objectivity. Regardless of the service provided or the role employees hold, they must defend the integrity of their work, maintain impartiality, and avoid submitting their judgment to others.

3. Fairness: Be fair and reasonable in all professional relationships. Disclose conflicts of interest. 
Fairness is putting one's feelings, biases, and desires on hold to establish a healthy balance of conflicting interests. Impartiality, intellectual honesty, and disclosure of substantial conflicts of interest are all required for fairness to be a good human being.

4. Confidentiality: Protect the confidentiality of all client information
Confidentiality refers to ensuring that information that is only available to those who are authorised access. The only way to build a trusting and confident connection with a customer, is to agree to information being private

5. Professionalism: Act in a manner that demonstrates exemplary professional conduct.
Professionalism means treating clients, employees, and everyone involved in business activities with respect and decency. Employees work together to improve the profession's public image and service quality.
